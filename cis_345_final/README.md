CIS 345 - Business Information Systems Development II:

'At the end of this course students will have the ability to 1) demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of
object-oriented programming techniques, 2) utilize APIs, 3) apply the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) tools,
techniques, and methodologies, and 4) develop applications making use of micro-services.'

Final project involved creating a GUI based python application which called a public API of our choice. I chose to 
create an app which would provide delay information based on a customer's flight. See my FAA repo for more code 
playing with FAA endpoinds.
